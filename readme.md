# Emacs #

This is simply my emacs directory. I don't really build it off of
anything like the emacs starter kit or Prelude. I prefer to simply
borrow approachs and hacks from them instead.

I borrow a lot of the structural setup from how prelude is setup. For
example, I preference everything with 'luca'. It seems easier to avoid
any possible naming issues.
